Personal and professional devices such as laptops, smartphones, PCs and tablets are becoming
more context-aware which are capable of storing large chunks of data that can be sensitive in
nature. Unauthorized access to these systems has potential to cause major disruptions and could
be fatal to the organization itself. Currently, various methods exist to secure these systems which
include the use of passwords, thumb-scan, PINS, locks, etc. However, each of these authorization
techniques suffer with their own drawbacks. Hence, it is advisable to devise a modern system
where users are monitored in real time and access can be withdrawn when an intrusion is detected.
Such systems make use of behavioural biometrics which monitors the interaction of the user with
the system. Ostensibly, real-time monitoring with such systems ensure utmost security to highly-
sensitive data since the identity of the user is supervised at all times. 

In this study, we apply various statistical and Machine Learning techniques to various datasets to monitor the system from
unauthorized access. Precisely, we use the data from Keyboard and Mouse dynamics to accomplish
this task and report our accuracy and findings in every case. We use Support Vector machines and
feed-forward neural network in the case of keyboard dynamics and compare their efficacy. For the
consequent mouse dynamics task, we apply an LSTM-based network as well taking advantage of
the inherent time-series data available with us. Our network gives an accuracy of around 93% with
a precision of 93.40% and recall of 93.34%, hence paving way for further research.
